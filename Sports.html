		Sports are an important part of life for many people, providing physical and emotional benefits that can last a lifetime.<br> Sports can teach valuable life lessons and foster a sense of discipline and commitment.<br> They can also provide a sense of belonging, community, and camaraderie.<br> From playing with friends in the park to competing in professional leagues, sports help to shape our lives in many ways.<br>
		Coming to Sports: I love to play cricket and it is my favourite game<br>
		Also I like to play footbal alongwith basketball.<br>
		Playing Sports makes your body fit and healthy physical as well as mentally.
